Deploy a Web application manually on Tomcat server

- To start the Tomcat server, we need to execute:
Tomcat\bin\startup.bat or startup.sh

If tomcat doesn't starts, then most probably it's because of JAVA_HOME environment variable not been set, for ex:
JAVA_HOME=c:\program files\java\jdk1.8.11_201

To confirm Tomcat is up and running, we can check from the browser by typing:
http://localhost:8080

If Tomcat is still not running, then it's most probably because of port issue. We need to change the port no. by editing
Tomcat\conf\server.xml

- The easiest way to deploy an application on Tomcat server 
  is by copying the war file in the Tomcat\webapps folder
