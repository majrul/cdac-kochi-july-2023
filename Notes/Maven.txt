To practice Maven:
- First we need download Maven if not done before:
	https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.3/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.3-bin.zip
- Then extract it somewhere
- Then set the PATH in Windows as an Environment Variable:
  - c:\apache-maven-3.9.3\bin
- On Mac/Linux, on the command prompt/terminal:
	export SET PATH=/path/to/apache-maven-3.8.6/bin:$PATH  
	
Now to compile our Maven project, we can say:
mvn compile

To run a particular java code using maven, we can say:
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.cdac.CreatePdf


To create a jar of our project, we can say:
mvn package
